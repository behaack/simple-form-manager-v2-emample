## Project Description
This project is to demonstate how easy it is to use Simple Form Manager V2, with and without a wrapper around your form controls

Note there is no code in the control wrapper component (my-input.vue). It accepts 3 props and then wires to props to the html template. The wrapper eliminated a lot of the control boilerplate.
